            <h1>Hebrew language</h1>
            <p> <b>Hebrew </b>(<bdi>עִבְרִית‎</bdi>) is a <a href="#">Northwest Semitic
                    language</a> native to <a href="#">Israel</a>. In 2013, Modern Hebrew was
                spoken by over nine million people worldwide.<br> Historically, it is regarded as the language of the
                Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name "Hebrew" in the
                Tanakh itself. <br> The Mishnah Megillah refers to the Hebrew language as Ashurit.The earliest examples
                of written Paleo-Hebrew date to the 10th century BCE.<br> Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of
                the Afroasiatic language family, and is the only Canaanite language still spoken and the only truly
                successful example of a revived dead language. </p>
            <p>Hebrew ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE, declining since the
                aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt.[2][13][note 2] Aramaic and, to a lesser extent, Greek were already
                in use as international languages, especially among elites and immigrants.[15] Hebrew survived into the
                medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy, rabbinic literature, intra-Jewish commerce and
                poetry. With the rise of national consciousness among Jews in the 19th century, it was revived as a
                spoken and literary language, becoming the main language of the Yishuv and subsequently of the State of
                Israel. According to Ethnologue, in 1998, Hebrew was the language of five million people worldwide.[5]
                After Israel, the United States has the second largest Hebrew-speaking population, with about 220,000
                fluent speakers,[16] mostly from Israel.</p>
            <p>Modern Hebrew is the official language of the State of Israel, while premodern Hebrew is used for prayer
                or study in Jewish communities around the world today. The Samaritan dialect is also the liturgical
                tongue of the Samaritans, while modern Hebrew or Arabic is their vernacular. As a foreign language, it
                is studied mostly by Jews and students of Judaism and Israel and by archaeologists and linguists
                specializing in the Middle East and its civilizations, as well as by theologians in Christian
                seminaries.</p>
            <p>Nearly all of the Hebrew Bible is written in Biblical Hebrew, with much of its present form in the
                dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, around the time of the Babylonian
                captivity. For this reason, Hebrew has been referred to by Jews as Lashon Hakodesh (לשון הקודש), "the
                holy language" or "the language of holiness", since ancient times. The Mishnah Megillah[17] refers to
                the Hebrew language as “Ashurit”. Dr. Joel Manual Hoffman states, “However, Megillah 17a (again in
                Hebrew) refers to a ‘foreigner who heard [the Megillah] in Ashurit.’ Here it looks like Ashurit refers
                to the Hebrew language, particularly in light of the point of the passage, which is that the foreigner
                who hears the Megillah in Ashurit has fulfilled his holy obligation to hear the Megillah, having heard
                it in a holy language.”</p>

        <h2 class="brd" id="link1">Etimology</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The modern English word "Hebrew" is derived from Old French Ebrau, via Latin from the Greek Ἑβραῖος
                (Hebraîos) and Aramaic 'ibrāy, all ultimately derived from Biblical Hebrew Ivri (עברי), one of several
                names for the Israelite (Jewish and Samaritan) people (Hebrews). It is traditionally understood to be an
                adjective based on the name of Abraham's ancestor, Eber, mentioned in Genesis 10:21. The name is
                believed to be based on the Semitic root ʕ-b-r (עבר) meaning "beyond", "other side", "across";[19]
                interpretations of the term "Hebrew" generally render its meaning as roughly "from the other side [of
                the river/desert]"—i.e., an exonym for the inhabitants of the land of Israel/Judah, perhaps from the
                perspective of Mesopotamia, Phoenicia or the Transjordan (with the river referenced perhaps the
                Euphrates, Jordan or Litani; or maybe the northern Arabian Desert between Babylonia and Canaan).[20]
                Compare the word Habiru or cognate Assyrian ebru, of identical meaning.</p>
            <p>One of the earliest references to the language's name as "Ivrit" is found in the prologue to the Book of
                Ben Sira,[a] from the 2nd century BCE.[22] The Hebrew Bible does not use the term "Hebrew" in reference
                to the language of the Hebrew people;[23] its later historiography, in the Book of Kings, refers to it
                as ‏יְהוּדִית‎ Yehudit 'Judahite (language)'.[</p>

            <p>Hebrew belongs to the Canaanite group of languages. Canaanite languages are a branch of the Northwest
                Semitic family of languages.[25] <br>

                According to Avraham Ben-Yosef, Hebrew flourished as a spoken language in the Kingdoms of Israel and
                Judah during the period from about 1200 to 586 BCE.[26] Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew was a
                spoken vernacular in ancient times following the Babylonian exile when the predominant international
                language in the region was Old Aramaic. <br>

                Hebrew was extinct as a colloquial language by Late Antiquity, but it continued to be used as a literary
                language and as the liturgical language of Judaism, evolving various dialects of literary Medieval
                Hebrew, until its revival as a spoken language in the late 19th century.[27][28]</p>
            <h3 id="link3">Oldest Hebrew inscriptions</h3>
            <p>Further information: Paleo-Hebrew alphabet and Ancient Hebrew writings</p>
            <p>In July 2008, Israeli archaeologist Yossi Garfinkel discovered a ceramic shard at Khirbet Qeiyafa that he
                claimed may be the earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, dating from around 3,000 years ago.[29]
                Hebrew University archaeologist Amihai Mazar said that the inscription was "proto-Canaanite" but
                cautioned that "The differentiation between the scripts, and between the languages themselves in that
                period, remains unclear," and suggested that calling the text Hebrew might be going too far.<br>

                The Gezer calendar also dates back to the 10th century BCE at the beginning of the Monarchic Period, the
                traditional time of the reign of David and Solomon. Classified as Archaic Biblical Hebrew, the calendar
                presents a list of seasons and related agricultural activities. The Gezer calendar (named after the city
                in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the Phoenician one that,
                through the Greeks and Etruscans, later became the Roman script. The Gezer calendar is written without
                any vowels, and it does not use consonants to imply vowels even in the places in which later Hebrew
                spelling requires them. <br>

                Numerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic
                languages, for example, Protosinaitic. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back to
                Egyptian hieroglyphs, though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the acrophonic principle. The
                common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is called Canaanite, and was the first to use a Semitic
                alphabet distinct from that of Egyptian. One ancient document is the famous Moabite Stone, written in
                the Moabite dialect; the Siloam Inscription, found near Jerusalem, is an early example of Hebrew. Less
                ancient samples of Archaic Hebrew include the ostraca found near Lachish, which describe events
                preceding the final capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian captivity of 586 BCE.</p>
            <h3 id="link4">Classical Hebrew</h3>

                <p>In its widest sense, Biblical Hebrew refers to the spoken language of ancient Israel flourishing
                    between the 10th century BCE and the turn of the 4th century CE.[31] It comprises several evolving
                    and overlapping dialects. The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary
                    works associated with them.
                    <ul>
                        <li> Archaic Biblical Hebrew from the 10th to the 6th century BCE, corresponding to the
                            Monarchic Period until the Babylonian Exile and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew
                            Bible (Tanakh), notably the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5).
                            Also called Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew. It was written in the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. A
                            script descended from this, the Samaritan alphabet, is still used by the Samaritans.</li>

                        <li> Hebrew script used in writing a Torah scroll. Note ornamental "crowns" on tops of certain
                            letters.</li>
                        <li> Standard Biblical Hebrew around the 8th to 6th centuries BCE, corresponding to the late
                            Monarchic period and the Babylonian Exile. It is represented by the bulk of the Hebrew Bible
                            that attains much of its present form around this time. Also called Biblical Hebrew, Early
                            Biblical Hebrew, Classical Biblical Hebrew or Classical Hebrew (in the narrowest sense).
                        </li>
                        <li> Late Biblical Hebrew, from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BCE, corresponding to the Persian
                            Period and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew Bible, notably the books of Ezra and
                            Nehemiah. Basically similar to Classical Biblical Hebrew, apart from a few foreign words
                            adopted for mainly governmental terms, and some syntactical innovations such as the use of
                            the particle she- (alternative of "asher", meaning "that, which, who"). It adopted the
                            Imperial Aramaic script (from which the modern Hebrew script descends). </li>
                        <li> Israelian Hebrew is a proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew, believed to have
                            existed in all eras of the language, in some cases competing with late biblical Hebrew as an
                            explanation for non-standard linguistic features of biblical texts. </li>
                </p>

            <p>Modern Hebrew is the primary official language of the State of Israel. As of 2013, there are about 9
                million Hebrew speakers worldwide,[68] of whom 7 million speak it fluently.[69][70][71]

                Currently, 90% of Israeli Jews are proficient in Hebrew, and 70% are highly proficient.[72] Some 60% of
                Israeli Arabs are also proficient in Hebrew,[72] and 30% report having a higher proficiency in Hebrew
                than in Arabic.[8] In total, about 53% of the Israeli population speaks Hebrew as a native language,[73]
                while most of the rest speak it fluently. However, in 2013 Hebrew was the native language of only 49% of
                Israelis over the age of 20, with Russian, Arabic, French, English, Yiddish and Ladino being the native
                tongues of most of the rest. Some 26% of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and 12% of Arabs
                reported speaking Hebrew poorly or not at all.[72][74]

                Steps have been taken to keep Hebrew the primary language of use, and to prevent large-scale
                incorporation of English words into the Hebrew vocabulary. The Academy of the Hebrew Language of the
                Hebrew University of Jerusalem currently invents about 2,000 new Hebrew words each year for modern words
                by finding an original Hebrew word that captures the meaning, as an alternative to incorporating more
                English words into Hebrew vocabulary. The Haifa municipality has banned officials from using English
                words in official documents, and is fighting to stop businesses from using only English signs to market
                their services.[75] In 2012, a Knesset bill for the preservation of the Hebrew language was proposed,
                which includes the stipulation that all signage in Israel must first and foremost be in Hebrew, as with
                all speeches by Israeli officials abroad. The bill's author, MK Akram Hasson, stated that the bill was
                proposed as a response to Hebrew "losing its prestige" and children incorporating more English words
                into their vocabulary.[76]

                Hebrew is one of several languages for which the constitution of South Africa calls to be respected in
                their use for religious purposes.[77] Also, Hebrew is an official national minority language in Poland,
                since 6 January 2005.</p>
